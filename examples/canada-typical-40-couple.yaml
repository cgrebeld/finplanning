# Per-scenario override payloads keyed by scenario ID.

# The scenario was built as a stats-anchored, not fully calibrated “typical household” profile.
# Main anchors I used:
# Household income level: StatsCan reports median after-tax income of $126,700 for couples with children (2023), which set the target scale for dual-income earners.
# Income of Canadians, 2023 (StatsCan)
# Age-40 wealth stage: For ages 35–44, StatsCan shows median net worth of $409,300 (2023), which informed a mid-accumulation household (some registered savings + mortgage still outstanding).
# Total and median net worth by age (StatsCan Table 1)
# Mortgage burden: StatsCan SFS 2023 reports 39% of families hold a mortgage, with median mortgage debt of $205,000; variable-rate holders’ median payment was about $2,020/month (young families higher). That supports the ongoing mortgage expense plus payoff event pattern.
# Survey of Financial Security, 2023 (StatsCan)
# Children’s post-secondary costs: StatsCan’s 2025/2026 average undergraduate tuition for Canadian students is $7,734 nationally ($6,862 in BC), and the scenario adds tuition + non-tuition costs into annual education expense blocks.
# Tuition fees 2025/2026 (StatsCan)
# RESP savings behavior: Annual RESP contributions were set near the common grant-optimized pattern (about $2,500 per child/year) because CESG is 20% of the first $2,500 per child.
# RESP/CESG rules (Canada.ca)
